# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

**Description:**

This GitHub repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting medical insurance costs. Healthcare costs are a significant concern for individuals and insurance providers, and this project aims to provide valuable insights and predictions to help both parties.

**Key Features:**

1. **Dataset Analysis:** The project begins with a comprehensive analysis of the medical insurance dataset, exploring variables such as age, BMI, smoking status, region, and charges.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

3. **Machine Learning Models:** Various machine learning algorithms are employed to build predictive models, including linear regression, random forests.

4. **Model Evaluation:** The models' performance is assessed using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to determine their predictive accuracy.

5. **Cost Predictions:** Users can input individual information, and the models will predict the estimated medical insurance cost based on the provided data.

6. **Jupyter Notebooks:** Detailed Jupyter notebooks are included, offering a step-by-step walkthrough of data analysis, model development, and predictions.

7. **How to Use:** The repository provides clear instructions on how to use the predictive models, making it accessible for individuals seeking insurance cost estimates.

**Usage:**

- Individuals can utilize the predictive models to estimate their potential medical insurance costs, helping with financial planning and decision-making.

- Insurance companies can incorporate these models to provide accurate quotes to their customers, optimizing pricing strategies.
